Waiter Tip Prediction with Jupyter Notebook

This repository explores predicting waiter tips using machine learning with a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview:
This project investigates factors influencing waiter tips in restaurants. It leverages a dataset containing information about restaurant visits and analyzes how features like bill amount, party size, or day of the week might affect the tip amount left for the waiter.

What's Included:
•	waiter_tips.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, model training, and evaluation for waiter tip prediction.
•	data (Optional): Folder containing the dataset used for training the model (if applicable).

How to Use:
1.	Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed like pandas, scikit-learn, etc. (Refer to the notebook for specific requirements).
2.	Load the Data: If the data is provided in a separate folder, modify the data loading section in the notebook to point to the correct location on your machine.
3.	Run the Notebook: Open waiter_tips.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment and execute the cells one by one (or use the "Run All" option). This will guide you through data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

Further Exploration:
•	Experiment with different machine learning models beyond the one used in the notebook.
•	Analyze the model's performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.
•	Visualize the relationship between features and tip amount using different plots and charts.
